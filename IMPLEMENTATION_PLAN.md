## Backtrack Points

Each version represents a stable point to which we can backtrack if issues arise. Key backtrack points:

1. **Base (v0.3)**: Working version with get_issue and search
2. **Core (v0.4)**: Basic CRUD operations working (current stable version)
   - Create, update, clone issues
   - Add comments to issues
   - Log work on issues
3. **Workflow (v0.5)**: Issue management working
4. **Projects (v0.6)**: Project operations working (partially implemented)
5. **Performance (v0.7)**: Optimized operations working

## Testing Strategy

For each step:
1. Write tests first
2. Implement feature
3. Verify in isolation
4. Test in Cursor
5. Document any issues
6. Only proceed if stable

## Configuration Management

mcp.json updates needed for each phase:
1. v0.4: Add issue templates
2. v0.5: Add workflow configs
3. v0.6: Add project settings
4. v0.7: Add performance settings
5. v0.8: Add security settings

## Rollback Procedure

If any step introduces instability:
1. Note the exact changes that caused issues
2. Revert to last known good version
3. Document the failure case
4. Try alternative approach
5. If alternative fails, stay at previous version

## Success Criteria

Final implementation should:
1. Be as stable as hello-world server
2. Support all core JIRA operations
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Maintain secure connections
5. Provide good developer experience
