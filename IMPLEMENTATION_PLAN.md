- [ ] Add environment validation safeguards
- [ ] Improve error handling for security events
- [ ] Add security-focused logging
Success criteria: Secure and robust access to JIRA API

### 8. Code Organization and Maintenance (NEW)
- [ ] Split JiraClient into focused modules:
  - [ ] core.py: Base client and connection handling
  - [ ] issues.py: Issue-related operations
  - [ ] projects.py: Project management
  - [ ] comments.py: Comment handling
  - [ ] worklog.py: Time tracking
- [ ] Create dedicated config module
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add interface definitions
- [ ] Create utility modules for common operations
Success criteria: Maintainable, modular codebase with clear separation of concerns

### 9. Advanced Transport (v0.9)
- [ ] Add SSE transport support
- [ ] Update mcp.json for SSE configuration
- [ ] Add proper connection handling
- [ ] Add reconnection logic
- [ ] Add transport-specific error handling
Success criteria: Stable alternative transport options

### 10. Production Readiness (v1.0)
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics
- [ ] Add health checks
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Add detailed logging
- [ ] Add production deployment guide
Success criteria: Production-ready with monitoring and maintenance tools

## Backtrack Points

Each version represents a stable point to which we can backtrack if issues arise. Key backtrack points:

1. **Base (v0.3)**: Working version with get_issue and search
2. **Core (v0.4)**: Basic CRUD operations working (current stable version)
   - Create, update, clone issues
   - Add comments to issues
   - Log work on issues
3. **Workflow (v0.5)**: Issue management working
4. **Projects (v0.6)**: Project operations working (partially implemented)
5. **Performance (v0.7)**: Optimized operations working

## Testing Strategy

For each step:
1. Write tests first
2. Implement feature
3. Verify in isolation
4. Test in Cursor
5. Document any issues
6. Only proceed if stable

## Configuration Management

mcp.json updates needed for each phase:
1. v0.4: Add issue templates
2. v0.5: Add workflow configs
3. v0.6: Add project settings
4. v0.7: Add performance settings
5. v0.8: Add security settings

## Rollback Procedure

If any step introduces instability:
1. Note the exact changes that caused issues
2. Revert to last known good version
3. Document the failure case
4. Try alternative approach
5. If alternative fails, stay at previous version

## Success Criteria

Final implementation should:
1. Be as stable as hello-world server
2. Support all core JIRA operations
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Maintain secure connections
5. Provide good developer experience

### Refactoring Benefits
- Improved maintainability through separation of concerns
- Better testability with focused modules
- Easier to implement new features
- Clear module boundaries and responsibilities
- Simplified dependency management

### Refactoring Approach
1. Create new structure while keeping current functionality
2. Move code gradually, one module at a time
3. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
4. Add tests for each new module
5. Update documentation as modules move
